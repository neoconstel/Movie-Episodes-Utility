# Movie Episodes Utility
Solves issues of missing or unordered episode filenames.

## More Detailed Summary
Sometimes you collect tons of movie episodes from someone, and it turns out 
the filenames are badly named using different naming conventions. This makes 
it difficult to sort the filenames accordingly to locate the ones you need at 
the moment. To handle this issue, the renaming functionality is provided to 
quickly rename all the episodes into a standard format with a desired title 
as the prefix.

Also, sometimes the filenames might or might not be orderly-named but they are 
too many and some are missing. How do you quickly know which ones are missing 
so you can decide to make a suitable resolution to the problem immediately, 
such as re-downloading them using the public WiFi in the restaurant you're 
currently eating at before heading back home? 
Well, that's why the missing episodes functionality is here to help.

## Features Implemented

from there.
