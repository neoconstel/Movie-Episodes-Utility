# Movie Episodes Utility
Solves issues of missing or unordered episode filenames.

## More Detailed Summary
Sometimes you collect tons of movie episodes from someone, and it turns out 
the filenames are badly named using different naming conventions. This makes 
it difficult to sort the filenames accordingly to locate the ones you need at 
the moment. To handle this issue, the renaming functionality is provided.

Also, sometimes the filenames might be orderly-named but they are too many and
some are missing. How do you quickly know which ones are missing so you can 
decide to make a suitable resolution to the problem immediately? Well, that's 
why the missing episodes functionality is here to help.
