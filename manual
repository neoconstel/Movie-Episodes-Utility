This utility helps with automated renaming of any number of movie episodes 
within a directory to a standard naming format. Also has functionality for 
obtaining a quick record of missing episodes. In running from a terminal, it 
should be ran from the directory containing the movie episodes which the user 
desires to operate on. For instance if your Samurai-X episodes are in 
the directory: /home/zoro/anime/samurai-x, you should navigate to 
/home/zoro/anime/samurai-x in your terminal and run "episode-utility" 
from there.
